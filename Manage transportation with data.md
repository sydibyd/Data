## List of the transportation related data models and standards
---- ---- ---- ---- ----

| Data model   | Description  |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| TRANSMODEL | Transmodel is the basis for defining exchange standards that enable the sharing and provision of accurate and interoperable public transport information across organisation- and system-boundaries. <be/> https://www.transmodel-cen.eu/transmodel-at-a-glance/ <br /> https://www.transmodel-cen.eu/siri-standard/ |
| GBFS (General Bikeshare Feed Specification) | The GBFS is an open data standard for shared mobility. <br /> https://gbfs.mobilitydata.org/ <br /> https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs |
| GTFS (The General Transit Feed Specification) | GTFS static or static transit to differentiate it from the GTFS realtime extension, defines a common format for public transportation schedules and associated geographic information. GTFS "feeds" let public transit agencies publish their transit data and developers write applications that consume that data in an interoperable way. <br/> https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs |
| GTFS Realtime | Providing users transit data updates in real time greatly enhances their experience of your transit services. Providing up-to-date information about current arrival and departure times allows users to smoothly plan their trips. As a result, in case of an unfortunate delay, a rider would be relieved to know that they can stay home a little bit longer. <br/> https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs-realtime |
| MDS (Mobility Data Specification) | https://www.openmobilityfoundation.org/about-mds/ <br /> https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification |
| TransXChange | UK nationwide standard for exchanging bus schedules and related data. <br/> https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/transxchange |
| Siri (Standard Interface for Real-time Information) | SIRI is a CEN Technical Standard that specifies a European interface standard for exchanging information about the planned, current or projected performance of real-time public transport operations between different computer systems. <br/> https://www.transmodel-cen.eu/siri-standard/ |

| NeTEx (Network Timetable Exchange) | TEXT |
